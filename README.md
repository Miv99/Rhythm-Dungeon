### Rhythm-Dungeon

ABANDONED PROJECT

My second attempt at a game.

The farthest I got was procedural map generation and the main combat system before I realized that this dungeon crawler would require a bunch of assets that I didn't have access to, and that its core gameplay had already been done (Tomb of the Necrodancer), so I abandoned it.
